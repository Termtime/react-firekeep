For the cloned version of the app to run, you need to create your own /src/constants/config.js file that contains all the constants used for the /src/providers/Firebase/FirebaseConfig.js configuration object.

## Running the app
First run npm install on the root directory.
Then you can do `npm start` to launch the app.
